LEARNING TESTS

Testing is everywhere. Tests assert that your code does exactly you want it to
do. But do you know about the didactic benefit of unit testing? Simple tests
can help you to understand how third party code works and ease the initial
training for new APIs or third party libraries.

A learning test can serve as a good reference. This project wants to collect
such learing tests. Primarily this tests explain the use case instead of
checking the code for its correctness.

This project was inspired by a section about learning tests from Robert C.
Martin in his book Clean Code.
